# quote-db

*Human-coined open repository of quotes from the 21st century*

## What is this?

A personal collection of quotes collected from various sources, intended 
to be used in `fortune`-like programs.

## Why?

**1** There's already lost of `fortune`s on the internet, but many of them come
from before the 90s and/or rely on copyrighted material (quotes from
songs, series, etc.)
   
**2** The explosion of social media has opened the doors for many individuals to publish lots of observations, aphorisms and other funny, witty or insightful words.

**3** Some of these are worthy of being collected for... science.

## Inclusion cirteria

*Please note that these are guidelines, not rules.* Also, there is not
and most likely there won't be any kind of profanity filter.

The quotes must:

1. Have been coined in the 21st Century (so adaptations or rephrasings are not 
   preferred)
2. Have been uttered/coined by individuals in personal capacity (so no quotes
   from series, music or similar materials)
3. **Contain no hate speech**
4. Be sourced with a username and platform (no links needed)

## Why is there a Northernlion-only database

This project started because the excellent [Northernlion Quote
Database](https://www.northernlion-db.com/Quotes) is not *very* open to the
public except for the browser interface. I started collecting a few quotes 
by myself and ended up with a separate file for this witty Canadian.
